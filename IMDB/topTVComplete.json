After the Ark's life support systems are found to be critically failing, one hundred juvenile prisoners are declared \"expendable\" and sent to the surface in a last ditch attempt to determine if Earth is habitable again. The teens arrive on a beautiful planet they've only seen from space. Confronting the dangers of this rugged new world, they struggle to form a tentative community. However they discover that not all humanity was wiped out. There are people on Earth who survived the war, called \"grounders\" by the 100.

The now 10-year-old Henry is in desperate need of Emma's help because he believes from reading a book of fairytales that she's the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming - who sent her away from the Enchanted Forest to be protected from a curse that was enacted by the Evil Queen. Emma initially refuses to believe a word of Henry's story but soon finds that his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine is more than it seems. Because it's in Storybrooke that all of the classic characters we know are frozen in time with no memories of their former selves - except for the Evil Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother Regina Mills. Now, as the epic \"Final Battle\" for the future of both worlds approaches, Emma will have to accept her destiny and uncover the mystery behind a place where fairytales are to be believed.","plot_synopsis":null,"poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODA4ODExNjMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcyOTk0ODE@.jpg","rating":8.0,"release_date":"23 October 2011 (USA)","tagline":"Magic is coming.

Called in by local police departments to assist in solving crimes of a serial and/or extremely violent nature where the perpetrator is unknown (referred to by the Unit as the unknown subject or unsub for short), the BAU uses the controversial scientific art of profiling to track and apprehend the unsub. Profiling entails coming up with basic characteristics of the unsub and the victims (referred to as the victimology), using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses as a means to solve the case. Because of the nature of the work conducted by the BAU - the work being time consuming and psychologically demanding - its members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members.

Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.","plot_synopsis":null,"poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjYzOTU2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAxMTg5MTE@.jpg","rating":8.7,"release_date":"23 June 2011 (USA)","tagline":"Two Lawyers.

Now in his second marriage to his gorgeous young wife, Gloria, Jay has been given something of a second chance. Still, old habits are hard to break, and it's trial by fire as he tries to adapt to life with the same passion and vigor that Gloria exhibits, which are matched by her precocious 12-year-old son, Manny. There are some culture clashes, a few misunderstandings, but also plenty of sweet victories along the way. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, are the proud parents of three kids with whom they want that open, healthy, honest relationship. It's not always easy, especially when you have Haley, a teenage daughter who's growing up a little fast, Alex, a too-smart-for-her-own-good middle daughter and Luke, a scatterbrained boy. Add to this that Phil is just a big kid himself, even if he does always have the best intentions. Claire is the anchor, trying her best to run a tight ship and determined not to let her kids have the rebellious childhood she had. Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, is busy raising an adopted daughter, Lily, with his long term partner, Cameron. Opposites attract in this household, with Cameron having a wonderfully big personality and maybe a flare for the dramatic, while Mitchell is more buttoned-down. They balance each other out, and these doting fathers are relishing their roles as parents developing their own little family.","plot_synopsis":null,"poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MjQ1MTE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgwMzg5NjE@.jpg","rating":8.6,"release_date":null,"tagline":"One big (straight, gay, multi-cultural, traditional) happy family.","trailer_url":null,"votes":236105,"writers":[],"year":2009},{"title":"Quantico","id":"4428122","aka":[{"version":"Estonia","title":"Quantico laager"},{"version":"Latvia","title":"Kvantiko"},{"version":"Russia","title":"База Куантико"}],"url":"http://akas.imdb.com/title/tt4428122/combined","cast_characters":["Alex Parrish (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Liam O'Connor (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Ryan Booth (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Miranda Shaw (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Shelby Wyatt (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Simon Asher (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Caleb Haas (22 episodes, 2015-2016)","Nimah Amin / ...

Helping him piece things together is his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson. The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.","plot_synopsis":null,"poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDEzOTYzMDkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkzNTAyNjE@.jpg","rating":9.0,"release_date":"15 April 2014 (USA)","tagline":"Aw jeez, here we go again.  »","trailer_url":null,"votes":156219,"writers":[],"year":2014},{"title":"Nashville","id":"2281375","aka":[{"version":"Serbia","title":"Nešvil"},{"version":"Russia","title":"Нэшвилл"},{"version":"Turkey (Turkish title)","title":"Nashville"},{"version":"Uruguay (dubbed version)","title":"Nashville"}],"url":"http://akas.imdb.com/title/tt2281375/combined","cast_characters":["Rayna Jaymes (87 episodes, 2012-2016)","Scarlett O'Connor (87 episodes, 2012-2016)","Juliette Barnes (87 episodes, 2012-2016)","Deacon Claybourne (79 episodes, 2012-2016)","Avery Barkley (79 episodes, 2012-2016)","Gunnar Scott (79 episodes, 2012-2016)","Maddie Conrad (74 episodes, 2012-2016)","Daphne Conrad (74 episodes, 2012-2016)","Teddy Conrad (66 episodes, 2012-2015)","Bucky Dawes (65 episodes, 2012-2016)","Will Lexington (64 episodes, 2013-2016)","Glenn Goodman (54 episodes, 2012-2016)","Luke Wheeler (49 episodes, 2013-2016)","Layla Grant (49 episodes, 2013-2016)","Emily (45 episodes, 2012-2016)","Roadie / ...
